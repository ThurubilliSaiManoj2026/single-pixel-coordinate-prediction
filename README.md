### Why MSE Loss?
- Direct optimization of coordinate prediction
- Continuous and differentiable
- Well-suited for regression tasks
- Penalizes large errors more heavily

### Dataset Design
- **Large Dataset**: 14,000 samples ensure good generalization
- **Uniform Distribution**: Prevents location bias
- **Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves convergence

## Dependencies
